    "```\n",
    "This point also holds for c and d.  \n",
    "Maybe all the stuff that we filtered out using `unique` above, we could just never look at it in the first place.\n",
    "3. In the solution above, we re-calculate a^3 + b^3 many times. So lets pre-compute all the possible values, and store them in a list\n",
    "4. I noticed that all the solutions are a _sandwhich_. I.e. a < c, d < b . Does this somehow reduce our search space?\n",
    "5. Maybe doing it as a difference of cubes could help? Maybe there's a maths trick in here somewhere with factorisation?\n",
    "```math\n",
    "                                         a^3 + b^3 = c^3 + d^3\n",
    "                             a^3 - c^3 + b^3 - d^3 = 0\n",
    "(a - c)(a^2 + ac + c^2) + (b - d)(b^2 + bd + d^2) = 0\n",
    "```\n",
