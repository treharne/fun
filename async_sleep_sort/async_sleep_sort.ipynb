    "The most intuitive idea is to use something called a **Priority Queue**.\n",

    "With Priority Queues, **prioritising** the elements just means you assign a number to how high priority each element is.  \n",
    "So with our list we want to sort, we can set the priority of each element to its value, analogously to how we set its sleep time to its value in SleepSort.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we wanted to sort a collection of elements, we could:\n",
    "1. Add the elements to a Priority Queue\n",
    "2. Take elements from the Priority Queue in order of priority\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole reason why this works, and is pretty fast, is because [Priority Queues are implemented using Heaps](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs2510h/lecture29.html), which is a type of binary tree where the *Heap Invariant* holds. It just means that the tree is constructed in a special way where every parent node has a higher value than its children.\n",
